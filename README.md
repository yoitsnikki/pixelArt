### This is the readme file for my final project

#### How to install
```
Create the main project Directory
npx create-react-app client in the root directory
npx express-generator api in the root directory
npm install in the api directory
npm install --save cors in the api directory

download 'react-circle-color-picker' from online

Open two terminals: run client in one, api in the other

```
#### Edit the Following Files

```
api/app.js
api/database.js

client/src/App.js
client/src/App.css

api/routes/testAPI.js
api/schema/color.js

```

#### Install MongoDB
```

Download Mongo from https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/enterprise?jmp=docs
Extract the tgz
Open terminal
Run the following (note the space after the *):
mv -v ~/Downloads/mongodb-macos-x86_64-4.2.0/bin/* /usr/local/bin

Navigate into the root directory
sudo mkdir -p /data/db
sudo chown -R `id -un` /data/db

mongod
mongo

Mongo DB is now set up! It should be running in terminals next to client and API

```

#### Next Steps
```
create a schema folder in api and add color.js to that folder
create database.js and add the code to that document
copy all the other codes into their respective files
Open four terminals: client, api, mongo, and mongodb
Your program should work!
```
